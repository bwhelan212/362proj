A calculator made in Python.

The main library that is being used is Tkinter for the GUI.

The calculator has a your regular number layout as you would on your keyboard number-pad.

It has simple calculation functions including: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

It is also capable of computing trigonometric functions.

We have also implemented buttons to convert regular numbers into binary numbers or hex numbers.

We added a neat history feature that will paste all the calculations done into a separate window.
You will be able to save your history into a file if so desired.

We have a simple bash script that will start up the calculator as well as perform some tests to see
if the calculator is running correctly.

TO RUN FILE: sh calc.sh
